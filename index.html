	<h1>The Dangers Of Anxiety</h1>
  	<p>
  Anxiety is a big issue in our world that many people aren't aware of. Many people think anxiety is just being scared when around people but it has a wide range of severity. In our project we highlight how severe aniety could get and try to spread awarness. We know as a group that this box won't change much but if eveyone strives to highlight the bad,  then maybe one day everyone will be able to understand what other have to go through
