	<h1>The Dangers Of Anxiety</h1>
  	<p>
  Anxiety is a big issue in our world that many people aren't aware of. Many people think anxiety is just being scared when around people but it has a wide range of severity. In our project we highlight how severe aniety could get and try to spread awarness. We know as a group that this box won't change much but if eveyone strives to highlight the bad,  then maybe one day everyone will be able to understand what other have to go through

	  <h1> Explanation of set</h1>
<p> First the girl tries to move to the front of the class to do a presentaion but her anxiety kicks in and that is represented by the clouds moving up and down. Then she physically does move up with the motors going side to side but in her head the lights are flashing on her and it is too much so she moves back.</p>

	  <h1> Code Explanation</h1>
<p> Above we have 2 codes. One is for the function of the girl moving and the other is for both the flashing lights and the movement of the clouds. The reason we split these codes up was because we needed one controller on top for the lights and the clouds but we somehow needed to get one on the bottome too. The one for the clouds is just a repeated motion of the clouds going one way at 100% then going the other way at 100%. The lights is the same concept with it turning on for a second then turing of then repeated. Lastly for the movement of the girl, it uses a servo motor so that we could set a specific angle the girl will go at and then reverse it to create the feeling she is moving forward then backwards.</p>
