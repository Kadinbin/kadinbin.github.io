    <h1><u>Claim</u></h1>
    <p>Their is a long loop of tubes inside the box</p>
    <h1><u>Evidence</u></h1>
    <p>The black box is a box where you put water in and a different amount of water come out each time. We saw that sometimes you put in water and nothing came out so we wanted to find out how that happened. We choose to use multiple buckets to see how it worked and also tubes. We knew the box didnt have and buckets because of us picking it up but we used it as a way to experiment. The water went from each bucket through tubing and eventually we saw similar results to the black box. The first couple trials we got 0’s by putting in 100ml and eventually it started being a random amount of water when we put in 200ml compared to the amount we put it(sometimes 90-200)/p>
    <h1><u>Reasoning</u></h1>
      <h2>Reasoning 1</h2>
    <p>Models are a test form of the real thing so that you could figure out how they work or show how they work in a better way. They are useful because you could do different experiments with them without having to use the real object. Some limitations to models are they might nit be exactly the same as the real thing causing the data to be different but a strength is that if anything bad happens it doesnt happen to the real one. /p>

    <h2>Reasoning 2</h2>
    <p>We saw that the buckets had little effect but the tubes did. Sometimes, water got stuck in the tubes because of how they were placed which would cause some 0’s to happen when you pour in water. Their also isn’t any buckets full of water in the box because of how we’re able to pick it up without water spilling all over./p>
    <h2>Reasoning3</h2>
    <p>Some may say that tubes wouldn’t work because all thre water would come right out. This is not true because our model wouldve had basically the same amount of water coming out each time .but if you configure the tubes properly, sometimes a small amount, no, or more water would come out</p>
