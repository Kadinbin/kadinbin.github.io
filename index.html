    <h1>Claim</h1>
    <p>Their is a long loop of tubes inside the box</p>
    <h1>Evidence</h1>
    <p>The black box is a box where you put water in and a different amount of water come out each time. We saw that sometimes you put in water and nothing came out so we wanted to find out how that happened. We choose to use multiple buckets to see how it worked and also tubes. We knew the box didnt have and buckets because of us picking it up but we used it as a way to experiment. The water went from each bucket through tubing and eventually we saw similar results to the black box. The first couple trials we got 0â€™s by putting in 100ml and eventually it started being a random amount of water when we put in 200ml compared to the amount we put it(sometimes 90-200)/p>
